# Red-Black Tree Visualization

This project provides a visualization of the Red-Black Tree data structure using C++ with Windows Forms.

## Introduction

Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance by enforcing additional constraints on the tree structure. It guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. This visualization code allows you to understand the structure and behavior of a Red-Black Tree visually.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of the Red-Black Tree using Windows Forms.
- Visual representation of tree nodes, including colors (red and black) and connections between nodes.
- Support for inserting nodes into the tree and automatic re-balancing.
- Clear visualization of the tree structure and the impact of insertions on the tree.

## Prerequisites

To run the Red-Black Tree visualization code, ensure you have the following:

- Visual Studio or another C++ IDE that supports Windows Forms development.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C++ IDE.

3. Build and compile the code.

4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

5. The visualization window will open, displaying an empty Red-Black Tree.

6. Use the provided user interface to insert nodes into the tree.

7. The visualization will update in real-time to reflect the changes in the tree structure.

## User Interface

The visualization window provides the following controls:

- **Insert Node**: Enter a value in the input field and click the "Insert" button to insert a node with that value into the tree.
- **Exit**: Click the close button to exit the program.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of values you can enter to insert nodes into the tree:

- Insert node with value 10: Enter "10" and click "Insert".
- Insert node with value 5: Enter "5" and click "Insert".
- Insert node with value 15: Enter "15" and click "Insert".
